# Scott Gartz Project 4
My overall plan for the 3 different interactive graphics is to have each graphic build on the previous one and increase the functionality or complexity of what the previous one did. Almost as a way to show it going from a conceptual stage to a more complex, finished product.
## Item #1
My initial plan was to create a field, where there are various shapes floating around slowly, sort of just existing. They aren't necessarily following any sort of pattern or path. However, when a user clicks on the screen I want the shapes to all start convering on that point. I could have different shapes have different movement patterns(Speed, path ie. straight vs zig zag)
## Item #2
My next plan was to take what I had from the first one, and now have object's reacting differently to the mouse. If the mouse if just hovering without clicking, I would give the objects a steering force pulling the objects slowly towards the mouse. If the user were to click, it would drop a node object, which the objects would know to pathfollow on any nodes. So if I user clicked 4 times they would have created a path for the objects to follow. As soon as one object reaches a node, I would delete the node.
## Item #3
I would then take what I had from the second item, and possibly create some sort of UI, stating how many nodes exist, how many objects exist, etc.  My plan now would be to have a check on click, if it was on the background or on an object. If it was on an object I would want to create some sort of visual effect, like lines shooting out of fireworks? Something along those lines. And then I would have the same thing happen to whatever object hits the node. I would then make a check for if the mouse is being held down, and if the mouse is, I would have it begin to create new objects.


## Things I need to learn
I would need to work on my javascript to manipulate all of these elements. My knowledge from IGME 202 will help me a lot with the steering behaviors I plan to implement. I will probably end up referencing stackoverflow when I need to, but also possibly other resources to brush up on the IGME-202 knowledge, such as my old notes or old work from that course.
