        <h2>Random Colour Function</h2>
        <h3>I tried and tried to make a random colour function but I couldn't figure out how to actually get it to work. I eventually found <a href="https://www.paulirish.com/2009/random-hex-color-code-snippets/">this page</a>, and used the function from there in order to get the random colour functionality.</h3>
        <h2>What I Used</h2>
        <h3>I used HTML Canvas for this entire project.</h3>
        <h2>What did I have to learn?</h2>
        <h3>Well, I had never used HTML Canvas before, so I had to completely teach myself how to use it. I also had to teach my self some linear algebra things in terms of rotation of points, in order to get the spinning triangles to work properly. I also had to learn how to get the triangles to properly move, while spinning, without distorting. And wrap without distorting.</h3>
        <h2>Above and Beyond</h2>
        <h3>I created every thing in this except for the randomColour function. I had to create my own vector class for use in position, velocity, acceleration etc.
        I created the Rectangles based on the parameters passed, the circles based on the parameters passed. I created the button class for the index page, and learned how to get canvas elements to link you to another page. I created the triangle class, had to trial and error to eventually get the triangle points to actually line up where
        they are meant to line up, while moving and spinning. I created a ton of functions to help with vector math, getting mouse clicks to work on circles vs. squares, getting mouse clicks to work on canvas in general. I had to find a way to keep spawning new objects while the mouse is held down, but if the mouse is just clicked, to not do this. I also had to figure out how to get the buttons on the menu screen to all be the same size, same font size, and resize everytime the size of the browser window changes. </h3>
