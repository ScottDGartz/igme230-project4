        <h2>Random Colour Function</h2>
        <h3>I tried and tried to make a random colour function but I couldn't figure out how to actually get it to work. I eventually found <a href="https://www.paulirish.com/2009/random-hex-color-code-snippets/">this page</a>, and used the function from there in order to get the random colour functionality.</h3>
        <h2>What I Used</h2>
        <h3>I used HTML Canvas for this entire project.</h3>
        <h2>What did I have to learn?</h2>
        <h3>Well, I had never used HTML Canvas before, so I had to completely teach myself how to use it. I also had to teach my self some linear algebra things in terms of rotation of points, in order to get the spinning triangles to work properly.</h3>
        <h2>Above and Beyond</h2>
        <h3>I created every thing in this except for the randomColour function. I had to create my own vector class for use in position, velocity, acceleration etc.
        I created the Rectangles based on the parameters passed, the circles based on the parameters passed. I created the button class for the index page, and learned how to get canvas elements to link you to another page. I created the triangle class, had to trial and error to eventually get the triangle points to actually line up where
        they are meant to line up. I created a ton of functions to help with vector math, getting mouse clicks to work on circles vs. squares, getting mouse clicks to work on canvas in general. I had to find a way to keep spawning new objects while the mouse is held down, but if the mouse is just clicked, to not do this. </h3>
